        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p className="useragreement" style={{overflow: "auto", height: "200px"}}>WHEREAS, Non-Profit own and operates
        a not for profit organization which arranges for tutoring of school children by volunteer independent contractors;  and
  
        WHEREAS, Independent Contractor desires to provide tutoring services as
        arranged by Non-Profit, and will gain and benefit from being provided such tutoring opportunities; and
  
        WHEREAS, the parties desire to specify the terms under which such
        tutoring shall be provided;
  
        NOW THEREFORE, in consideration below describe covenants and promises
        between the parties, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
        acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
  
        1. Tutoring. Independent Contractor shall provide tutoring services
        as assigned by Non-Profit, subject to the terms and requirements of this
        agreement. Independent Contractor acknowledges and agrees that it shall
        receive no compensation of any kind for any tutoring provided under this
        agreement, and Independent Contractor covenants that it shall not pursue
        compensation of any kind from the tutored student of the family of the
        tutored student. Independent Contractor agrees with Non-Profit that the
        education, skill and experience constitute compensation sufficient to
        warrant consideration between the parties.
  
        2. Standards of Conduct. Independent Contractor shall maintain the
        highest standard of conduct in all interactions with students, other
        volunteers and teachers, and any other person they come into contact
        with while serving as a volunteer with Non-Profit. Independent
        Contractor shall not discuss, display, or portray lewd, indecent or
        inappropriate subject, images, or pictures at any time. Independent
        Contractor shall respect the individuality and privacy of all
        tutored students, and shall treat such students with the highest respect.
  
        3. Termination. Non-Profit retains the right to terminate
        the services of Independent Contractor at any time for
        any reason or no reason whatsoever. This contract constitutes a
        right to work contract and can be terminated by either party at
        any time and for reason. In the event of any breach of this
        Agreement by Independent Contractor, this Agreement shall be
        automatically terminated unless Non-Profit notifies Independent
        Contractor that the Agreement is still in force and effect.
  
        4. Confidentiality. In the course of providing tutoring
        services, Independent Contractor may acquire confidential
        information from Non-Profit or from tutored students
        and/or their families. Confidential information
        includes, but is not limited to, all lists, data
        or information of any kind pertaining to Non-Profit
        or tutored students which is not, at the time it
        is acquired, generally available to the public.
        Independent Contractor shall not at any time
        reveal or use in any fashion such confidential
        information without the prior express permission of the
        party who owns the information. This provision shall
        continue in full force and effect after Independent
        Contractor ceases to provide tutoring services for
        Non-Profit. Independent Contractor acknowledges
        that damages which Non-Profit may suffer from a
        breach of this paragraph are difficult or impossible
        to determine, but in no way is such information
        valued at less than Five Hundred and 00/100
        Dollars ($500.00). This amount constitutes
        a specified amount of minimum damages
        between the parties and not liquidated damages.
  
        In addition, Non-Profit may obtain injunctive
        relief to prevent Independent Contractor from further
        dissemination of confidential information. If Non-Profit
        is required to take legal action against Independent
        Contractor as a result of a breach of any of the
        covenants contained in this paragraph 4 or any other
        clause contained within this employment contract,
        he or she will be responsible for the reasonable
        attorney's fees accumulated as a result of said breach.
  
        5.  Indemnification.  Each party shall indemnify
        and holt the other party and its offices,
        agents, and employees harmless from and
        against all liabilities, damages, losses,
        actions, or causes of action, costs
        and expenses, including reasonable
        attorney’s fees if related to the
        provision of tutoring services by
        Independent Contractor in this agreement,
        as well as any claims related to personal
        injury or death arising out of or in any
        way contributed to by the acts or failure
        to act of the other party, its agents,
        employees, officers or assigns, including,
        but not limited to, the careless, reckless,
        negligent, wanton or willful conduct of
        Independent Contractor.
  
        Independent Contractor is responsible to obtain
        and maintain its own insurance, and no insurance
        will be provided by Non-Profit.  Non-Profit
        shall not be liable for any acts of Independent
        Contractor, regardless of the nature of those
        acts, the only exception being if such acts
        by Independent Contractor were part of the
        day to day activities of his or her job with
        Non Profit and no negligence nor intentional
        conduct on the part of Independent Contractor occurred.
  
        6.  Independent Contractor.  The parties acknowledge
        that Independent Contractor and its supplied
        laborers are independent contractors.
        Non-Profit has no obligation to provide withholding
        of taxes or other employee services on their behalf,
        and Independent Contractor and its supplied
        laborers shall not have the power to enter into
        any contracts, agreements or any other commitments
        on behalf of Non-Profit.  Independent Contractor
        hereby acknowledges that should the law in the
        locale in which the tutoring is to take place
        require worker’s compensation insurance to be
        carried, that is solely the responsibility of
        the independent contractor.
  
        7.  Entire Agreement.  This agreement embodies the
        entire ”four corners” of the agreement between
        the parties, and replaces any prior understandings
        or discussions of the parties.  This Agreement
        may only be changed or modified in writing,
        signed by both parties.
  
        8.  Successors and Assigns.  All of the terms
        and conditions of this Agreement are binding
        on the successors and assigns of both parties.
        Independent contractor may not assign this
        Agreement or its duties under this Agreement
        to any other party, without the written consent
        of Non Profit.  Non Profit may not sell or
        assign its rights under this Agreement without
        the prior written consent of Independent Contractor.
  
        9.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed
        by and construed in accordance with the laws of
        the State of Utah.  Venue for any legal action
        between the parties shall be Utah County, Utah.
  
        10. Dispute Resolution.  In the event of a dispute
        between the parties regarding this Agreement,
        the parties shall first negotiate in good faith
        to see if such dispute can be resolved.  If any
        claim or action is filed in court by either
        party respecting this Agreement, the prevailing
        party shall be entitled, in addition to all
        expenses, costs or damages, to reasonable
        attorneys’ fees, whether or not such controversy
        was litigated or prosecuted to judgment.
  
        11.  Severability. If any term or provision of
        this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or
        unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement
        shall not be affected thereby.  Each term and
        provision of this Agreement shall be valid
        and enforced to the fullest extent permitted
        by law.
  
        12. Notices. Any notice provided for or concerning
        this agreement shall be in writing and be deemed
        sufficiently given when hand delivered or sent
        by certified or registered mail if sent to the
        respective address of each party:
  
        13. Headings and Drafting.  The headings used
        herein are for purposes of convenience only and
        should not be used in construing or interpreting
        the provisions hereof.  In all questions of
        interpretation of this agreement, the parties
        shall jointly be considered to have been the
        drafters of the same.  This Agreement may be
        executed in counterparts.  Facsimile signatures
        of this agreement shall be considered binding,
        and the same as original signatures.
  
        14. Compliance with Law. Each party warrants
        that all times they are and will remain in
        compliance with all applicable federal, state
        and local laws pertaining to the services
        provided for in this agreement.  Failure
        to comply with this paragraph by an
        independent contractor or anyone under
        the employment of an Independent Contractor
        shall result in the immediate breach of this agreement.</p>
