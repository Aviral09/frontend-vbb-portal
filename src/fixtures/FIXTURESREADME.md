# Fixtures

## Purpose

The purpose of the fixtures is to act as the response from the backend API. These can be used for writing test or building out a feature. They should be modelled after the [Swagger docs for the python backend ](https://vbb-backend.herokuapp.com/swagger/). Keys should be written in `snake_case`. Values should be representative of real data ( i.e. Phone numbers should be localized, timezones should be accurate)
